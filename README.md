# Spotify Track Classification 🎵

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning models to classify Spotify tracks based on their audio features.
The goal is to predict whether a track belongs to a target category using features such as:
- Energy
- Danceability
- Valence
- Tempo

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Techniques Applied
- Train-test split
- Class imbalance handling (class_weight="balanced")
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision / Recall / F1-score
- Feature importance analysis

## Results
Random Forest achieved strong classification performance with improved recall on minority class.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

This project was built as part of my self-learning journey in machine learning and data analysis.
